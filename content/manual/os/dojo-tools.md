Below are the various [generators][generator], [threads][thread] and other tools
included with the `%base` desk and usable in the [dojo][dojo]. These are
organized into rough categories for convenience.

## Apps and updates

These tools are for managing [desks][desk], apps and updates. Install,
uninstall, suspend, pause updates, etc.

### `+agents`

Print out the status of Gall agents on a desk.

Agents may either be `archived` or `running`. Nuked or unstarted agents which
are not on the manifest are omitted.

#### Arguments

desk
```

#### Example

```
> +agents %garden
status: running   %hark-system-hook
status: running   %treaty
status: running   %docket
status: running   %settings-store
status: running   %hark-store
```

---

### `|bump`

Try to apply a kernel update.

If `%zuse`'s kelvin version has decreased, try to apply the update. If any desks
are incompatible with the new `%zuse` version, the update will fail. The update
can be forced with the optional `force` argument, in which case incompatible
desks will be `|suspend`ed. The `set` of desks to omit (and therefore suspend)
can also be explicitly specified with the optional `except` argument.

#### Arguments

All optional:

```
, =force ?, =except (set desk)
```

#### Examples

Try to apply update, failing if blocked by any desks:

```
|bump
```

Force the update, suspending incompatible desks:

```
|bump, =force &
```

Apply kernel update, omitting and suspending the specified desks:

```
|bump, =except (silt ~[%bitcoin %webterm])
```

---

### `|install`

Install a desk, starting its agents and listening for updates.

If it's a remote desk we don't already have, it will be fetched. The agents
started will be those specified in the `desk.bill` manifest. If it has a docket
file, its tile will be added to the homescreen and its glob fetched. If we
already have the desk, the source for updates will be switched to the ship
specified.

It takes a `ship` and `desk` as its mandatory arguments. The desk may be
installed with a different name specified in the optional `local` argument.

#### Arguments

```
ship desk, =local desk
```

#### Examples

```
|install ~zod %bitcoin
```

```
|install our %webterm
```

```
|install ~zod %bitcoin, =local %foo
```

---

### `|nuke`

Shut down an agent and permanently delete its state.

The default behaviour is to shut down the specified Gall agent and discard its
state, similar to the now-deprecated `|fade` generator. **Note this irreversibly
wipes the app's state**. Additionally, if the optional `desk` argument is `%.y`,
it takes a desk rather than an agent name and nukes every agent on the specified
desk.

#### Arguments

```
@tas, =desk ?
```

#### Examples

Nuke a single agent:

```
|nuke %btc-wallet
```

Nuke every agent on a desk:

```
|nuke %bitcoin, =desk &
```

---

### `|ota`

Set the source of updates for the `%base` desk (the kernel and core apps) to the
specified ship. Automatic updates will be enabled, and any new updates available
will be fetched and installed.

#### Arguments

```
ship
```

#### Examples

`|ota ~marzod` is equivalent to `|install ~marzod %kids, =local %base`.

---

### `|pause`

Pause updates on a desk.

The specified desk will stop tracking updates from its upstream source.

#### Arguments

```
desk
```

#### Examples

```
|pause %bitcoin
```

---

### `|rein`

Adjust the state of a desk.

This allows you to stop and start agents on a desk, regardless of whether
they're on the manifest. Stopped agents have their states archived. It can also
suspend and revive the whole desk with the optional `liv` argument.

#### Arguments

```
desk (list [? dude:gall]), =liv ?
```

#### Examples

Start an agent:

```
|rein %bitcoin [& %btc-provider]
```

Stop an agent, archiving its state:

```
|rein %bitcoin [| %btc-wallet]
```

Stop one agent, start another:

```
|rein %bitcoin [| %btc-wallet] [& %btc-provider]
```

Suspend a desk:

```
|rein %bitcoin, =liv |
```

Revive a desk:

```
|rein %bitcoin
```

---

### `|revive`

Revive all agents on a desk, migrating archived states.

All agents specified in `desk.bill` which are suspended will be restarted. If
updates to the agents have occurred since their states were archived, they'll be
migrated with the state transition functions in the agent. This generator does
the same thing as selecting "Resume App" from the app tile's hamburger menu.

#### Arguments

```
desk
```

#### Examples

```
|revive %bitcoin
```

---

### `+show-vat`

Print kelvin version and manifest.

This prints the contents of `/sys/kelvin` and `/desk/bill`.

#### Example

```
> +show-vat %garden
/sys/kelvin:
[%zuse 418]
/desk/bill:
~[%docket %treaty %hark-store %hark-system-hook %settings-store]
```

---

### `|start`

Start an [agent][agent].

#### Arguments

```
term term
```

This first `term` is mandatory, the second is optional. If two terms are
provided, the first is the [desk][desk] and the second is the agent on that desk
to start. If only one term is provided, it's the name of the agent, and the desk
is inferred to be the current desk (typically `%base`).

#### Example

```
> |start %landscape %chat-cli
>=
```

---

### `|suspend`

Shut down all agents on a desk, archiving their states.

The tile in the homescreen (if it has one) will turn gray and say "Suspended" in
the top-left corner. This generator does the same thing as selecting "Suspend"
from an app tile's hamburger menu.

#### Arguments

```
desk
```

#### Examples

```
|suspend %bitcoin
```

---

### `|uninstall`

Uninstall a desk, suspending its agents and ignoring updates.

The specified desk will be retained in Clay, but its agents will all be stopped
and have their states archived like [`|suspend`](#suspend). This is the reverse
of [`|install`](#install).

Note that this will not remove the tile or glob from the homescreen, so if the
desk has a tile it should be uninstalled with the "Remove App" button in the
tile's hamburger menu.

#### Arguments

```
desk
```

#### Examples

```
|uninstall %bitcoin
```

---

### `+vat`

Print out the status of a single installed desk.

Desks in Clay which aren't installed will be omitted. See the related
[`+vats`](#vats) command for details of the individual status fields.

#### Arguments

`desk, =verb ?`

The desk is mandatory while `=verb` is optional and sets verbosity. If `=verb`
is `|`, the print-out will be brief. If `=verb` is `&` or not specified at all,
the print-out will be more detailed.

#### Examples

Default verbosity (high):

```
> +vat %base
/sys/kelvin:      [%zuse 414]
base hash:        0v8.n40h1.hjn8c.e762q.ncgh0.e4gq3.6n3l5.5kt8l.6gtdr.ovbah.u3avd
%cz hash:         0v8.n40h1.hjn8c.e762q.ncgh0.e4gq3.6n3l5.5kt8l.6gtdr.ovbah.u3avd
app status:       running
force on:         ~
force off:        ~
publishing ship:  ~
updates:          local
source ship:      ~
source desk:      ~
source aeon:      ~
kids desk:        ~
pending updates:  ~
```

Low verbosity:


```
> +vat %base, =verb |
/sys/kelvin:      [%zuse 414]
app status:       running
publishing ship:  ~
pending updates:  ~
```

---

### `+vats`

Print out the status of each installed desk.

Also see the related [`+vat`](#vat) command, which prints the status of a
single desk rather than all desks.

Fields:

- `/sys/kelvin` - The kernel version(s) the desk is compatible with.
- `base hash` - The merge base (common ancestor) between the desk and its upstream source.
- `%cz hash` - The hash of the desk.
- `app status` - May be `suspended` or `running`.
- `force on` - The set of agents on the desk which have been manually started
  despite not being on the `desk.bill` manifest.
- `force off` - The set of agents on the desk which have been manually stopped
  despite being on the `desk.bill` manifest.
- `publishing ship` - The original publisher if the source ship is republishing
  the desk.
- `updates` - May be `local`, `remote` or `paused`. Local means it will
  receive updates via commits on the local ship. Remote means it will receive
  updates from the `source ship`. Paused means it will not receive updates.
- `source desk` - The desk on the `source ship`.
- `source aeon` - The revision number of the desk on the `source ship`.
- `pending updates` - Updates waiting to be applied due to kernel
  incompatibility.

#### Arguments

```
?(%suspended %running %blocking %nonexistent), =verb ?, =show-suspended ?, =show-running ?, =show-blocking ?, =show-nonexistent ?
```

All arguments are optional.

With no arguments, it prints verbose details for all desks. If the optional
`=verb` argument is set to `|`, verbosity is reduced.

It may optionally take one of four filters as a primary argument:

- `%suspended`: filter for suspended desks only.
- `%running`: filter for desks that are installed and running.
- `%blocking`: filter for desks that are blocking a kernel update due to
  incompatibility.
- `%nonexistent`: filter for desks we should have but don't yet.

Alternatively, these filters can be *excluded* from the default output of
everything by setting one or more of the `=show-*` arguments to `|`.


#### Examples

Print everything verbosely (no arguments):

```
> +vats
  %base

  %cz hash:         0v8.n40h1.hjn8c.e762q.ncgh0.e4gq3.6n3l5.5kt8l.6gtdr.ovbah.u3avd            
  app status:       running

  %foo
  /sys/kelvin:      [%zuse 415]
  app status:       suspended

### `+trouble`

Print out the status of each installed desk.

This is a synonym for [`+vats`](#vats).

#### Example

See [`+vats`](#vats).

---

## Azimuth

Tools for managing PKI updates from [Azimuth][azimuth].

### `+azimuth-block`

Print the most recent Ethereum block that has been processed.

This is a good way to check if your ship's somehow got behind on PKI state. If
the block printed is substantially behind the most recent Ethereum block, it
indicates a problem. Note it's normal for it to be a little behind.

#### Example

```
> +azimuth-block
15.664.748
```

---

### `:azimuth|kick`

Kick Azimuth.

Restart `%eth-watcher`, resubscribe, re-process snapshot and updates.

#### Example

```
> :azimuth|kick
>=
ship: processing azimuth snapshot (0 points)
```

---

### `:azimuth|listen`

Add a source for PKI updates for a list of ships.

Sets the source that the public keys for a set of ships should be obtained from.
This can either be a Gall agent that communicates with an Ethereum node as in
the case of galaxies, stars, and planets, or a ship, as in the case of moons.

#### Arguments

Either:

```
(list ship) %ship ship
```

Or:

```
(list ship) %app term
```

The list of ships are those for which you want Azimuth updates from the
specified source. The source is either a ship (`%ship ~sampel`) or an agent
(`%app %some-agent`).

#### Example

```
> :azimuth|listen ~[~sampel ~palnet] %ship ~wet
>=
```

---

### `-azimuth-load`

Refetch and load Azimuth snapshot.

#### Example

```
> -azimuth-load
ship: loading azimuth snapshot (106.177 points)
[%eth-watcher 'overwriting existing watchdog on' /azimuth]
ship: processing azimuth snapshot (106.177 points)
```

---

### `+azimuth-sources`

List all Azimuth sources.

This will print a
[`state-eth-node:jael`](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/arvo/jael/data-types#state-eth-node)
structure. Its contents is mostly other ships who are sources for updates about
moons, but it will also include `%azimuth`.

#### Example

```
> +azimuth-sources
[ top-source-id=0
  sources={}
  sources-reverse={}
  default-source=0
  ship-sources={}
  ship-sources-reverse={}
]
```

---

### `:azimuth|watch`

Change node URL and network for Azimuth.

#### Arguments

```
cord ?(%mainnet %ropsten %local %default)
```

The first argument is the note URL in a cord like
`'http://eth-mainnet.urbit.org:8545' `. The second argument specifies the
network.

#### Example

```
> :azimuth|watch 'http://eth-mainnet.urbit.org:8545' %default
>=
```

---

## CLI Apps

These commands are for managing the dojo and other CLI apps.

### `:dojo|acl`

Show which ships you've allowed remote access to your dojo.

#### Example

```
~zod:dojo> :dojo|allow-remote-login ~bus
>=

~zod:dojo> :dojo|acl
>=
{~bus}
```

---

### `:dojo|allow-remote-login`

Allow a ship to `|link` your dojo.

#### Arguments

The ship you want to allow remote access.

```
ship
```

#### Example

Allow ~bus to link ~zod's dojo:

```
~zod:dojo> :dojo|allow-remote-login ~bus
>=

~zod:dojo> :dojo|acl
>=
{~bus}
```

Link ~zod's dojo on ~bus:

```
~bus:dojo> |link ~zod %dojo
>=
[linked to [p=~zod q=%dojo]]

~zod:dojo>
```

---

### `:dojo|wipe`

Clear the dojo's subject.

This will clear all values pinned to the dojo's subject with commands like `=foo
42`.

#### Example

```
> =foo 42

> foo
42

> :dojo|wipe
>=

> foo
-find.foo
dojo: hoon expression failed
```

---

### `:dojo|revoke-remote-login`

Revoke permission for a remote ship to `|link` your dojo.

#### Arguments

The ship whose permission you wish to revoke.

```
ship
```

#### Example

```
~zod:dojo> :dojo|allow-remote-login ~bus
>=

~zod:dojo> :dojo|acl
>=
{~bus}

> :dojo|revoke-remote-login ~bus
>=

> :dojo|acl
>=
{}
```

---

### `|link`

Connect a local or remote CLI app.

Note a ship's moons can automatically link its dojo, but other ships require
explicit permission with [`:dojo|allow-remote-login`](#dojoallow-remote-login).

#### Arguments

```
ship term
```

The `ship` is optional, it's only necessary if the app is on a remote ship. The
`term` is mandatory, and is the name of the CLI app to connect.

#### Example

Connect to the dojo on a remote ship (this is only possible if you have
permission):

```
|link ~sampel-palnet %dojo
>=
[linked to [p=~sampel-palnet q=%dojo]]
~sampel-palnet:dojo>
```

Connect to the `%chat-cli` app locally:

```
|link %chat-cli
>=
[linked to [p=~zod q=%chat-cli]]
~zod:chat-cli/ 
```

Note you can cycle between CLI apps with Ctrl+x. You can disconnect a CLI app
with the [|unlink](#unlink) command.

---

### `|unlink`

Disconnect a local or remote CLI app.

#### Arguments

```
ship term
```

The `ship` is optional, it's only necessary if the app is on a remote ship. The
`term` is mandatory, and is the name of the CLI app to disconnect.

#### Example

Disconnect the local `%chat-cli` app:

```
> |unlink %chat-cli
>=
[unlinked from [p=~zod q=%chat-cli]]
```

Disconnect from a remote dojo session:

```
> |unlink ~sampel-palnet %dojo
>=
[unlinked from [p=~sampel-palnet q=%dojo]]
```

---

## Developer tools

These tools are mostly useful to developers or similarly technical people.

### `.`

Make a jamfile and write to disk. A noun is jammed and then written to
`pier/.urb/put/path/extension` using a `%sag` `%blit`, saving it as a jamfile.

#### Arguments

```
path/extension noun
```

#### Example

This command is often used for writing pills to disk - see e.g.
[`+solid`](#solid).

```
> .solid/pill +solid %base
```

You can also jam arbitrary nouns, e.g.

```
> .decrement/atom [8 [1 0] 8 [1 6 [5 [0 7] 4 0 6] [0 6] 9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] 0 7] 9 2 0 1]
```

This is the Nock formula for decrement. If you copy it from
`/pier/.urb/put/decrement.atom` to `pier/base` then you can run it by
scrying it from Clay and running `+cue` to reobtain the formula. 

```
> .*(100 (cue .^(@ %cx %/decrement/atom)))
99
```

### `@`

Write atom to a file in binary.

#### Arguments

```
path @
```

#### Example

```
> `@test/atom 123`
```

will create a file called `test.atom` in `pier/.urb/put/test.atom`. The contents
of this file is a binary representation of the atom, `1111011`.

### `+ames-flows`

Print details of [Ames][ames] flows by ship.

#### Arguments

This argument is optional:

```
@ud
```

If no argument is provided, it will print details of Ames flows for all ships,
sorted by the number of flows. If a number n is provided as an argument, it'll
only print the top n results.

#### Example

All flows:

```
> +ames-flows
~[
  [ ship=~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod
    open=[out-open=3 out-closing=0 in=0 nax=0]
    corked=0
  ]
  [ship=~nec open=[out-open=1 out-closing=0 in=0 nax=0] corked=0]
  [ ship=~dister-dozzod-dozzod
    open=[out-open=1 out-closing=1 in=0 nax=0]
    corked=0
  ]
  [ ship=~lander-dister-dozzod-dozzod
    open=[out-open=1 out-closing=0 in=0 nax=0]
    corked=0
  ]
]
```

Top 2 ships:

```
> +ames-flows 2
~[
  [ ship=~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod
    open=[out-open=3 out-closing=0 in=0 nax=0]
    corked=0
  ]
  [ship=~nec open=[out-open=1 out-closing=0 in=0 nax=0] corked=0]
]
```

---

### `|ames-prod`

Reset congestion control; re-send packets immediately.

Ames uses a backoff algorithm for congestion control. This can be inconvenient
when debugging in certain cases, you may have to wait a couple of minutes before
an unacknowledged packet is re-sent. This generator resets congestion control,
causing at least one pending packet to be immediately re-sent for each flow.

#### Arguments

```
ship ship ship ...
```

If no argument is given, congestion control will be reset for all flows.
Otherwise, you can specify a number of `ship`s, and congestion control will only
be reset for flows to those ships.

#### Example

```
> |ames-prod
>=

> |ames-prod ~bus ~wex
>=
```

---

### `|ames-sift`

Filter Ames debug printing by ship.

This filters the output controlled by [`|ames-verb`](#ames-verb).

#### Arguments

```
ship ship ship ....
```

If no argument is given, filtering is disabled. Otherwise, Ames debug printing
will be filter to only include the specified ships.

#### Example

Enable filtering:

```
> |ames-sift ~nec ~bus
>=
```

Disable filtering:

```
> |ames-sift
>=
```

---

### `|ames-snub`

Blacklist/whitelist ships in Ames.

All packets from either the blacklisted ships or all non-whitelisted ships (as
the case may be) will be dropped.

#### Arguments

```
?(%allow %deny) ship ship ship ship ....
```

(Either `%allow` or `%deny` then a list of ships.)

- `%allow` or `%deny` set whether the following ships are a whitelist or blacklist.

{% callout %}

Note that while `%deny` is ordinary blacklist blocking, `%allow` means *any*
ships not on the list will be blocked.

Note also that this generator totally overrides existing snub settings - it
doesn't just add or remove ships from an existing list.

{% /callout %}

#### Example

Create a blocklist:

```
> |ames-snub %deny ~wet ~sampel ~sampel-palnet
>=
```

Create a whitelist (and therefore block everyone else):

```
> |ames-snub %allow ~wet ~sampel ~sampel-palnet
>=
```

---

### `+ames-timers`

Print Ames message-pump timers by ship.

#### Arguments

```
@ud
```

If no argument is provided, it will print details of Ames timers for all ships,
sorted by the number of timers. If a number n is provided as an argument, it'll
only print the top n results.

#### Example

Print all the Ames timers for all ships:

```
> +ames-timers
~[
  [~.~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod 3]
  [~.~dister-dozzod-dozzod 2]
  [~.~lander-dister-dozzod-dozzod 1]
]
```

Print the top two ships:

```
> +ames-timers 2
~[[~.~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod 3] [~.~dister-dozzod-dozzod 2]]
```

### `|ames-verb`

Enable verbose Ames debug printing.

#### Arguments

```
verb verb verb...
```

A `verb:ames` is one of `%snd %rcv %odd %msg %ges %for %rot`. Each one enables
printing of different kinds of events. You can enable as many as you want at one
time. If `|ames-verb` is given no argument, it disables all Ames debug printing.

For details of the meaning of these `verb`s, see its entry in the [Ames Data
Types
documentation](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/arvo/ames/data-types#verb).

#### Example

```
> |ames-verb %msg
>=

> |hi ~nec
>=
ames: ~nec: plea [[~zod 1] [~nec 1] bone=[0 %g /ge/hood]]

> |ames-verb
>=
```

---

### `|ames-wake`

Clean up Ames timers.

Set timers for [Ames][ames] flows that lack them, cancel timers for Ames flows
that have them but shouldn't.

#### Example

```
> |ames-wake
>=
```

---

### `+brass`

Build a brass [pill][pill].

A *brass* pill is a complete bootstrap sequence that recompiles the vanes,
unlike a [`+solid`](#solid) pill which does not.

#### Arguments

```
%base-desk %extra-desk-1 %extra-desk-2 ...
```

The first argument is the desk to be used as "base", containing the kernel etc.
Any extra desks are optional.

The base desk may alternatively be specified as a [path][path] to a `/sys`
directory including the [path prefix][path prefix] like
`/=some-desk=/foo/bar/sys`. In that case, the path prefix from that path will be
used to determine the base desk. This is only useful if you want the start-up
events in the pill to use an alternative compiler or Arvo source.

#### Example

Export a brass pill containing just the `%base` desk:

```
> .brass/pill +brass %base
%brass-parsing
%brass-parsed
%brass-compiling
%brass-compiled
[%user-files 420]
```

The pill will now be available in `<pier>/.urb/put/brass.pill` in the host
filesystem.

Export a brass pill with multiple desks:

```
> .brass/pill +brass %base %garden %webterm
%brass-parsing
%brass-parsed
%brass-compiling
%brass-compiled
[%user-files 128]
[%user-files 93]
[%user-files 420]
```

---

### `-build-cast`

Build a static mark conversion gate.

#### Arguments

```
path
```

The [path][path] is of the format `%/from-mark/to-mark`. It must being with the
[path prefix][path prefix] denoting the desk that contains the specified mark
files.

#### Example

```
> =tape-to-json -build-cast %/tape/json
> (tape-to-json "foo")
[%s 'foo']
```

---

### `-build-file`

Build a Hoon file.

#### Arguments

```
path
```

The [path][path] points to a [Hoon][hoon] file in [Clay][clay]. It must begin
with the [path prefix][path prefix].

#### Example

```
> =numbers -build-file %/lib/number-to-words/hoon
> (to-words:eng-us:numbers 42)
[~ "forty-two"]
```

---

### `-build-mark`

Build a dynamic mark core.

A dynamic [mark][mark] [core][core] is one that deals with `vase`s rather direct
values. Its type is a `dais:clay`.

#### Arguments

```
path
```

The path is a [path prefix][path prefix] followed by the mark, like `%/txt`. The
mark in question must exist in the desk specified by the prefix.

#### Example

```
> =txt-dais -build-mark %/txt
> !<  (urge:clay cord)  (~(diff txt-dais !>(~['foo' 'bar'])) !>(~['foo' 'baz']))
~[[%.y p=1] [%.n p=<|bar|> q=<|baz|>]]
```

---

### `-build-nave`

Build a static mark core.

A static [mark][mark] [core][core] is one that deals with values directly rather
than vases. Its type is a `nave:clay`.

#### Arguments

```
path
```

The path is a [path prefix][path prefix] followed by the mark, like `%/txt`. The
mark in question must exist in the desk specified by the prefix.

#### Example

```
> =txt-nave -build-nave %/txt
> (diff:txt-nave ~['foo' 'bar' 'baz'] ~['foo' 'zoo' 'baz'])
~[[%.y p=1] [%.n p=<|bar|> q=<|zoo|>] [%.y p=1]]
```

---

### `-build-tube`

Build a dynamic mark conversion gate.

A *dynamic* [mark][mark] conversion [gate][gate] is one that deals with `vase`s
rather that plain nouns. Its type is a `tube:clay`.

#### Arguments

```
path
```

The [path][path] is of the format `%/from-mark/to-mark`. It must being with the
[path prefix][path prefix] denoting the desk that contains the specified mark
files.

#### Example

```
> =txt-mime-tube -build-tube %/txt/mime
> !<  mime  (txt-mime-tube !>(~['foo']))
[p=/text/plain q=[p=3 q=7.303.014]]
```

---

### `+dbug`

Query the state or [bowl][bowl] of a running agent.

#### Arguments

See the [dbug section of App School lesson
3](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/core/app-school/3-imports-and-aliases#dbug)
for details of usage.

#### Example

This is only used with an `:agent`, not by itself.

```
> :graph-store +dbug [%state '(~(got by graphs) ~zod %dm-inbox)']
>=
>   [p={} q=[~ %graph-validator-dm]]
```

---

### `|gall-sear`

Clear pending `move` queue from a ship.

#### Arguments

```
ship
```

The ship from which queued moves should be cleared.

#### Example

```
> |gall-sear ~nec
>=
```

---

### `|gall-sift`

Set Gall verbosity by agent.

This filters the debug output toggled by [`|gall-verb`](#gall-verb).

#### Arguments

```
%agent1 %agent2 %agent3....
```

If agents are specified, debug prints will be filtered to only those agents. If
no arguments are given, filtering will be disabled.

#### Example

Filter to just these agents:

```
> |gall-sift %graph-store %dojo
>=
```

Disable filtering:

```
> |gall-sift
>=
```

---

### `|gall-verb`

Toggle Gall debug printing.

#### Arguments

```
%odd
```

If the `%odd` argument is provided, Gall will print debug information about
errors like duplicate `%watch` acks, subscriptions closing due to an agent
crashing on a `%fact`, etc.

If no argument is given, such debug printing will be disabled.

#### Example

Turn on error messages:

```
> |gall-verb %odd
>=
```

Turn off error messages:

```
hi ~nec successful
> |gall-verb
>=
```

---

### `|pass`

Pass a task to a vane.

{% callout %}

**Warning**

This is a powerful command and has the potential to break things if
you're not careful.

{% /callout %}

#### Arguments

```
note-arvo
```

A `note-arvo` is defined in `lull.hoon` as:

```
+$  note-arvo
  $~  [%b %wake ~]
  $%  [%a task:ames]
      [%b task:behn]
      [%c task:clay]
      [%d task:dill]
      [%e task:eyre]
      [%g task:gall]
      [%i task:iris]
      [%j task:jael]
      [%k task:khan]
      [%$ %whiz ~]
      [@tas %meta vase]
  ==
```

It's a [vane][vane] letter (`%a` for Ames, `%b` for Behn, etc) followed by one
of that vane's tasks.

Note that you can't receive any gifts in response.

#### Example

Run `-hi our "foo"` via Khan:

```
> |pass [%k %fard %base %hi noun+!>([~ our "foo"])] 
>=
< ~zod: foo
```

Pass a `%text` task to Dill:

```
> |pass [%d %text "foo"]
>=
foo
```

---

### `-read`

Read a file, local or remote.

While [`+cat`](#cat) can only read text files, the `-read` [thread][thread] can
read any kind of file, directory or [desk][desk] on any ship it has permission
to read. This thread doesn't pretty-print the result like `+cat`, it just
produces the data.

`-read` isn't limited to ordinary file reads, but can make requests using any
[care][care]. Some `care`s might be useful, such as `%u` to check file
existence. Others have obscure technical uses. The most common is `%x`, which is
a normal read.

#### Arguments

```
care ship desk case path
```

- [care][care]: One of `%a %b %c %d %e %f %p %r %s %t %u %v %w %x %y %z`,
  denoting a [Clay][clay] submodule. For details of their meaning, see the [Clay
  data types
  documentation](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/arvo/clay/data-types#careclay-clay-submode)
  and [Clay scry
  reference](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/arvo/clay/scry).
- [ship][ship]: The target ship like `~sampel`, or `our` for the local ship.
- [desk][desk]: The [desk] on that ship like `%base`.
- [case][case]: The revision you're requesting. This can be one of:
  - `ud+123` - A revision number.
  - `da+now` - The revision at that date-time. You can use `now` for the most
    recent or an `@da` for another time.
  - `tas+foobar`: A revision label, these are rarely used.
- [path][path]: The filepath like `/gen/code/hoon`. Note the Clay path prefix is
  not included since that data was specified separately.

#### Example

Read `sys.kelvin` in the `%base` desk on the local ship at the current revision:

```
> -read %x our %base da+now /sys/kelvin
kel=[lal=%zuse num=418]
```

Check for the existence of that same file:

```
> -read %u our %base da+now /sys/kelvin
%.y
```

---

### `|serve`

Bind a generator to a URL path.

See the [Eyre
Guide](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/arvo/eyre/guide#generators) for
details of writing web-facing generators.

#### Arguments

```
path desk path
```

The first [path][path] is the URL path to bind like `/foo/bar/baz`. The second
`path` is the path to the generator in `desk` like `/gen/who/hoon` (note it does
not include the [path prefix][path prefix]).

#### Example

Bind `/gen/who/hoon` in the `%base` desk to the `/who` URL path:

```
> |serve /who %base /gen/who/hoon
>=
bound: %.y
```

In a Unix terminal, try requesting it:

```
> curl http://localhost:8080/who
{"who":"zod"}
```

---

### `+solid`

Build a solid [pill][pill].

A *solid* pill is a partial [`+brass`](#brass) pill, it doesn't recompile the
vanes and so boots faster. It is intended for development purposes, not
production.

#### Arguments

```
%base-desk %extra-desk-1 %extra-desk-2 ...
```

The first argument is the desk to be used as "base", containing the kernel etc.
Any extra desks are optional.

The base desk may alternatively be specified as a [path][path] to a `/sys`
directory including the [path prefix][path prefix] like
`/=some-desk=/foo/bar/sys`. In that case, the path prefix from that path will be
used to determine the base desk. This is only useful if you want the start-up
events in the pill to use an alternative compiler or Arvo source.

#### Example

Export a solid pill containing just the `%base` desk:

```
> .solid/pill +solid %base
%solid-start
%solid-loaded
%solid-parsed
%solid-arvo
[%solid-kernel 0x7c8c.3271]
lull: ~daptyl-fodsen
zuse: ~hadmel-rigrel
vane: %ames: ~podmex-soldef
vane: %behn: ~sartes-masnyl
vane: %clay: ~haptyv-natnev
vane: %dill: ~tindus-rabrys
vane: %eyre: ~wolsem-milsup
vane: %gall: ~folbex-mapfur
vane: %iris: ~macryl-midnyl
vane: %jael: ~molpec-rolhus
vane: %khan: ~mosryp-donleg
[%user-files 420]
```

The pill will now be available in `<pier>/.urb/put/solid.pill` in the host
filesystem.

Export a solid pill with multiple desks:

```
> .solid/pill +solid %base %garden %webterm
%solid-start
%solid-loaded
%solid-parsed
%solid-arvo
[%solid-kernel 0x5ee.3781]
lull: ~daptyl-fodsen
zuse: ~hadmel-rigrel
vane: %ames: ~podmex-soldef
vane: %behn: ~sartes-masnyl
vane: %clay: ~haptyv-natnev
vane: %dill: ~tindus-rabrys
vane: %eyre: ~wolsem-milsup
vane: %gall: ~folbex-mapfur
vane: %iris: ~macryl-midnyl
vane: %jael: ~molpec-rolhus
vane: %khan: ~mosryp-donleg
[%user-files 128]
[%user-files 93]
[%user-files 420]
```

---

### `-test`

Run tests for a library.

#### Arguments

```
(list path)
```

Each [path][path] is a path to a file to test, and must include the [path
prefix][path prefix].

#### Example

Refer to the [Unit Test
Guide](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/additional/unit-tests) for details of
using the `-test` thread.

---

### `+timers`

Print out currently running [Behn][behn] timers.

#### Examples

```
> +timers
~[
  [ date=~2022.9.25..10.54.36..ac0c
    duct=~[/ames/pump/~pocwet/0 /ames]
  ]
  [date=~2022.9.25..10.54.36..af7c duct=~[/ames/pump/~wet/8 /ames]]
  [date=~2022.9.25..10.54.36..b166 duct=~[/ames/pump/~nus/4 /ames]]
  [date=~2022.9.25..10.54.36..b3cf duct=~[/ames/pump/~wet/4 /ames]]
.....(truncated for brevity).....
```

---

## Filesystem (Basic)

These are basic tools for things like copying files, navigating directories,
etc.

### `+cat`

Read a file at the given location and print its contents in the dojo.

If the specified [path][path] points to a directory rather than file, it will
list the files in that directory like the [`+ls`](#ls) command documented below.

`+cat` can only print text-based files like `.hoon` source-code, `.txt`,
`.html`, etc. It won't work for binary blobs or other non-text files.

#### Arguments

The `path` is mandatory, the `vane` is optional. 

```
path, =vane ?(%c %g)
```

The past must include a [path prefix][path prefix].

It *can* query [Gall][gall] [agents][agent] rather than [Clay][clay] files if
the optional `, =vase %g` argument is given. In that case, it will perform a
`%gx` [scry][scry] to the given scry path. The type returned must be some kind
of text file, either a `@t` or a `wain` (a `(list @t)`). Most agents do not have
scry endpoints that produce text files so the `%g` feature is rarely useful.

#### Example

Read a [hoon][hoon] file:

```
> +cat %/gen/cat/hoon
/~zod/base/~2022.9.4..11.01.12..c392/gen/cat/hoon
::  ConCATenate file listings
::
::::  /hoon/cat/gen
  ::
/?    310
/+    pretty-file, show-dir
::
::::
  ::
:-  %say
|=  [^ [arg=(list path)] vane=?(%g %c)]
=-  tang+(flop `tang`(zing -))
.......(truncated for brevity)..........
```

List the files in a directory:

```
> +cat %/sys/vane
  * /~zod/base/~2022.9.4..11.02.01..5b0a/sys/vane
  ames/hoon
  behn/hoon
  clay/hoon
  dill/hoon
  eyre/hoon
  gall/hoon
  iris/hoon
  jael/hoon
  khan/hoon
```

---
### `|cp`

Copy a file.

#### Arguments

The first [path][path] is to the file and the second is where to copy it.

```
input=path output=path
```

Both the input and output paths must include the full [path prefix][path prefix].

The output path must end with an explicit filename and [mark][mark], you can't
just point it at a directory.

#### Example

Copy the `code.hoon` generator to the root of `%base` with the name `foo.hoon`:

```
> |cp %/gen/code/hoon %/foo/hoon
>=
+ /~zod/base/9/foo/hoon
```

Let's list the files in the root of `%base`:

```
> +ls %
  app/
  desk/bill
  foo/hoon   <- new file with contents of %/gen/code/hoon
  gen/
  lib/
  mar/
  sur/
  sys/
  ted/
```

---

### `=dir`

Change working directory.

Note this is not a [generator][generator] or [thread][thread] as are most other
tools documented. Rather, it is a special command built directly into the dojo.

#### Arguments

```
path
```

The path must include the [path prefix][path prefix].

If no path is specified, it will switch back to the default location (the root
of the `%base` desk at its most recent revision).

#### Example

Let's try changing to the root of the `%garden` [desk][desk]:

```
> =dir /=garden=
=% /~zod/garden/~2022.9.4..13.15.48..5e81
```

The dojo prompt will now look like:

```
~zod:dojo/=/garden/~2022.9.4..13.15.48..5e81>
```

`%` and `/===` now resolve to this location, so any commands like 
[`+ls %`](#ls), [`+tree %`](#tree), etc, will be run against this location.

The working directory doesn't need to be the root of a desk, you can also do
`=dir /=base=/gen/hood`, etc.

If you specify a different [case][case] in the path prefix like `=dir /=base/1`,
you will switch to that revision.

To switch back to the default location (the root of the `%base` desk at its most
recent revision), you just run `=dir` without an argument.

---

### `+ls`

List files and directories at the specified location.

#### Arguments

The `path` is mandatory, the `vane` is optional:

```
path, =vane ?(%c %g)
```

The path must include the [path prefix][path prefix].

The default behavior of `+ls` is to query Clay, but [Gall][gall] [agents][agent]
can also be queried by specifying the optional `=vane %g` argument like `+ls
/=some-agent=/foo/bar, =vane %g`. This will perform a [scry][scry] of the form
`.^(arch %gy /=some-agent=/foo/bar)`. Very few Gall agents implement `%y` scry
endpoints that produce `arch` types, so this feature is almost entirely useless.

#### Example

```
> +ls %/sys/vane
  ames/hoon
  behn/hoon
  clay/hoon
  dill/hoon
  eyre/hoon
  gall/hoon
  iris/hoon
  jael/hoon
  khan/hoon
```

Note the [mark][mark] (file type/extension) is separated with a `/` rather than
a `.` as is common in other systems: `hoon` is not a sub-directory of `ames`
here, it is the mark. Directories can be distinguished from files by their lack
of a mark; they'll just look like `app/`.

---

### `+mv`

Move a file from one location to another.

#### Arguments

The first [path][path] is to the file and the second is where to move it.

```
input=path output=path
```

Both paths must include the [path prefix][path prefix].

The output path must end with an explicit filename and [mark][mark], you can't
just point it at a directory.

#### Example

Create a file:

```
> *foo/txt ~['foo' 'bar' 'baz']
+ /~zod/base/16/foo/txt
```

Move it:

```
> |mv %/foo/txt %/bar/txt
>=
- /~zod/base/17/foo/txt
+ /~zod/base/17/bar/txt
```

---

### `|rm`

Delete a file.

Note you cannot delete a directory, but a directory will be disappear once all
its files are gone.

#### Arguments

```
path
```

The path must include the [path prefix][path prefix].

#### Example

Create a file:

```
> *foo/txt ~['foo' 'bar' 'baz']
+ /~zod/base/22/foo/txt
```

Delete it:

```
> |rm %/foo/txt
>=
- /~zod/base/23/foo/txt
```

---

### `+tree`

Display all files in the given directory and its sub-directories.

#### Arguments

```
path
```

The path must include the [path prefix][path prefix].

#### Example

```
> +tree %/sys
/sys/arvo/hoon
/sys/hoon/hoon
/sys/kelvin
/sys/lull/hoon
/sys/vane/ames/hoon
/sys/vane/behn/hoon
/sys/vane/clay/hoon
/sys/vane/dill/hoon
/sys/vane/eyre/hoon
/sys/vane/gall/hoon
/sys/vane/iris/hoon
/sys/vane/jael/hoon
/sys/vane/khan/hoon
/sys/zuse/hoon
```

---


## Filesystem (Advanced)

These are more advanced desk and filesystem tools.

### `|autocommit`

Enable automatic commits for a mounted [desk][desk].

Auto-commits can be disabled with [`|cancel-autocommit`](#cancel-autocommit).

{% callout %}

### WARNING

Autocommit can cause very substantial event-log bloat and quickly eat GBs of
disk space. **It is advisable not to use this**.

{% /callout %}

#### Arguments

```
desk
```

#### Example

In the dojo:


```
> |mount %garden
>=

> |autocommit %garden
>=
```

In a separate Unix shell session:

```
echo "foo" > ~/piers/zod/garden/foo.txt
```

Back in the dojo:

```
+ /~zod/garden/8/foo/txt
```

---

### `|cancel-autocommit`

Cancel automatic commits for all mounted [desks][desk].

Note this will cancel automatic commits for all desks, it's not possible to
target a single desk.

#### Examples

```
> |cancel-autocommit
>=
```

---

### `|commit`

Commit changes to mounted [desk][desk].

#### Arguments

```
desk, =auto ?
```

The `desk` is mandatory, the `=auto` is optional.

If `=auto` is `.y`, auto-commits will be enabled, meaning changes to that desk
on the host side will automatically be committed as soon as they happen.

Auto-commits can be disabled with [`|cancel-autocommit`](#cancel-autocommit).

#### Example

In the dojo:

```
> |mount %garden
>=
```

In a separate Unix shell session:

```
echo "foo" > ~/piers/zod/garden/foo.txt
```

Back in the dojo:

```
> |commit %garden
>=
+ /~zod/garden/6/foo/txt
```

---

### `|fuse`

Perform an octopus merge.

A `%fuse` request in [Clay][clay] replaces the contents of `%destination-desk`
with the merge of the specified `beak`s according to their merge strategies.
This has no dependence on the previous state of `%dest` so any commits/work
there will be overwritten.

`|fuse` extends this concept with the idea of a tracked source. When specifying
beaks to include in your fuse, specify `%track` instead of a [case][case]. This
will tell `|fuse` to retrieve the latest version of the source beak *and* to
rerun the `%fuse` request whenever that tracked source changes. A fuse can have
many tracked sources, or none. The base may be tracked as well.

#### Arguments

Either:

```
desk %cancel
```

Or:

```
desk path [germ path] [germ path]..., =overwrite ?
```

The first argument is the target `desk` that will be overwritten. After that is
either `%cancel` to cancel an existing tracked fuse, or else a `path` followed
by a series of `[germ path]`. The first `path` is a `beak` like
`/~zod/foo/track` or `/~zod/foo/5`, and is the base of the octopus merge. For
the remaining `[germ path]`, the `germ` is the merge strategy (for details run
`|merge` without arguments and read the help text it prints), and the `path` is
another `beak`.

The optional `=overwrite` flag allows you to overwrite a currently ongoing fuse.
Without this flag, attempting a fuse into a desk that you already `|fuse`'d into
will error.

For usage details, you can run `|fuse` without arguments and it'll print out a
help text.

#### Examples

```
|fuse %dest /=kids= mate+/~nel/base= meet+/~zod/kids/track

|fuse %old-desk /=kids= only-that+/~nus/test=, =overwrite &

|fuse %desk-to-cancel-fuse-into %cancel
```

---

### `|fuse-list`

Print tracked fuse sources for a desk.

See the [`|fuse`](#fuse) command for details.

#### Example

```
> |fuse-list %base
>=
no ongoing fuse for %base
```

---

### `|label`

Add a label to a [desk][desk] revision.

Labels let you name particular commits, and then refer to them by that name
rather than date or revision number.

#### Arguments

```
desk term, =aeon @ud
```

The `desk` and `term` are mandatory, the `=aeon` is optional. The `term` is the
label to give the revision. If an `aeon` is not specified, it will default to
the most recent revision.

#### Example

```
> |label %base %foo
>=
labeled /~zod/base/foo

> |label %base %bar, =aeon 1
>=
labeled /~zod/base/bar

### `|merge`

Merge one desk into another.

#### Arguments

```
desk ship desk, =cas case, =gem ?(germ %auto)
```

The first `desk` is the local merge target. The second `desk` is the merge
source on the specified `ship`. The optional `=cas` argument specifies a
particular [case][case] (revision reference) like `ud+5`, `da+now`, etc. The
optional `=gem` argument specifies a merge strategy. The default merge
strategies is `%auto`, which does a fast-forward `%fine` merge if the target
desk exists, and creates a new desk with `%init` if not.

For details of usage and all the different merge strategies, run `|merge`
without arguments for a help text.

#### Example

```
> |merge %bitcoin ~bus %bitcoin, =gem %only-this
>=
merged with strategy %only-this
```

---

### `|mount`

Mount a [desk][desk] or directory to the host filesystem.

#### Arguments

A whole desk:

```
desk
```

A directory:

```
path
```

If it's a [path][path], it must include the full [path prefix][path prefix].

Note you can't mount a single file directly.

#### Example

Mount the whole `%base` desk:

```
> |mount %base
>=
```

The desk is now accessible at `<pier>/base` in the host filesystem.

Mount the `/gen` directory of the `%base` desk:

```
> |mount %/gen
>=
```

The `/gen` directory is now accessible at `<pier>/gen` in the host filesystem.

---

### `|norm`

Add a tombstone policy rule.

Note that the policy will not be automatically applied when set, you'll need to
run [`|pick`](#pick) for the garbage collection to occur.

#### Arguments

```
ship desk path keep=?
```

The [path][path] is to a file or directory on the given `desk` on the given
`ship`. The `?` is `.n` if it should be tombstoned, `.y` if it should be kept.

#### Examples

```
> |norm our %bitcoin /gen .n
>=

> |norm our %bitcoin /app .y
>=

> |norm our %webterm / .n
>=

> |norm our %webterm /gen .y
>=

> +norms
~tus/%bitcoin:
  /app: %.y
  /gen: %.n
~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod/%bitcoin:
~tus/%base:
~tus/%webterm:
  /gen: %.y
  /: %.n
~tus/%kids:
~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod/%webterm:
~tus/%garden:
~lander-dister-dozzod-dozzod/%landscape:
~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod/%garden:
~tus/%landscape:
```

---

### `+norms`

Print tombstone policies for all desks.

#### Example

```
> +norms
~tus/%bitcoin:
  /app: %.y
  /gen: %.n
~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod/%bitcoin:
~tus/%base:
~tus/%webterm:
  /gen: %.y
  /: %.n
~tus/%kids:
~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod/%webterm:
~tus/%garden:
~lander-dister-dozzod-dozzod/%landscape:
~mister-dister-dozzod-dozzod/%garden:
~tus/%landscape:
```

`%.y` means old revisions of the file or directory will be kept, `%.n` means
they'll be tombstoned.

---

### `|pick`

Apply tombtoning policies; collect garbage.

#### Example

```
> |pick
>=
```

---

### `|private`

Make a [desk][desk], directory or file private (prevent remote ships from
reading it).

Note that if a desk or directory is publicly readable, making any directories or
files inside of it private will prevent remote ships from syncing the entire
desk/directory. They'll still be able to read the individual parts that aren't
private though, just not the whole thing.

Desks, files and directories can be made publicly readable again with
[|public](#public).

#### Arguments

```
desk path
```

The `desk` is mandatory, the [path][path] is optional. If specified, the `path`
is a directory or file in the given desk.

#### Example

```
> |private %garden
>=

> |private %base /ted/dns
>=
```

---

### `|public`

Make a [desk][desk], directory or file publicly readable (allow remote ships to
read it).

Things can be made private again with [`|private`](#private).

#### Arguments

```
desk path
```

The `desk` is mandatory, the [path][path] is optional. If specified, the `path`
is a directory or file in the given desk.

#### Example

```
> |public %garden
>=

> |public %base /ted/dns
>=
```

---

### `|story-init`

Create a new story file (commit message log) for a [desk][desk].

#### Arguments

All arguments are optional:

```
, =desk desk, =overwrite ?
```

If no desk is given, the current desk will be used (typically `%base`).
Otherwise, the specified `=desk` will be used. If `=overwrite` is `.y`, any
existing story file in the desk will be overwritten with a blank one.

#### Example

```
> |story-init
>=
+ /~tus/base/7/story
```

```
> |story-init, =desk %garden, =overwrite .y
>=
+ /~tus/garden/2/story
```

---

### `+story-list`

Print out a [desk][desk]'s story (commit messages), unordered.

#### Arguments

```
, =desk
```

If the optional `=desk` argument is not specified, it'll infer the current desk
(typically `%base`).

#### Example

```
> +story-list, =desk %garden

commit: 0v10.blbfu.8a414.qrjqo.ov847.gc6v7.6dpob.49i6s.ndi49.ve74j.a04qr
                                                                        some title

                                                                                  some body
                                                                                           |||
                                                                                              aaaaaaaaa

                                                                                                       bbbbbbb
    ---
```

---

### `+story-read`

Print out a [desk][desk]'s story (commit messages) in order.

#### Arguments

```
, =desk desk
```

If the optional `=desk` argument is provided, it'll print out the story for that
desk. If no argument is provided, it'll infer the current desk (typically
`%base`).

#### Example

```
> +story-read, =desk %garden
commit: 0v10.blbfu.8a414.qrjqo.ov847.gc6v7.6dpob.49i6s.ndi49.ve74j.a04qr
some title

some body
```

---

### `|story-remove`

Remove commit message(s) for a given commit from a desk's story.

#### Arguments

```
cash, =desk desk, =prz prose
```

A `cash` is either a [case][case] like `ud+2`, `da+now`, etc, or a `[%tako
tako:clay]` commit reference. If the optional `=desk` argument is not given,
it'll infer the current desk (typically `%base`). The optional `=prz` argument
is a `prose`, which is `[title=@t body=@t]`. If `=prz` is given, only that
specific prose will be removed from the messsages of the specified commit.

#### Example

---

### `|story-write`

Add a commit message to a desk's story.

Note that you can run this more than once to add multiple messages to the same
commit.

#### Arguments

```
title=@t body=@t, =desk desk, =cas cash
```

Only the `title` is mandatory. If the `=desk` argument is not provided, it'll
infer the current desk (typically `%base`).

The optional `=cas` may either be a [case][case] like `da+now`, `ud+2`, etc, or
else a `[%tako tako:clay]` commit reference. If a `=cas` is not provided, it'll
default to the most recent.

#### Example

```
> |story-write 'some title' 'some body', =desk %garden, =cas ud+1
>=
: /~tus/garden/3/story

> +story-read, =desk %garden
commit: 0v10.blbfu.8a414.qrjqo.ov847.gc6v7.6dpob.49i6s.ndi49.ve74j.a04qr
some title

some body
```

---

### `|sync`

Continuously merge into local desk from another local or remote desk.

Every change on the source desk will be merged into the local one. This tracking
can be stopped with [`|unsync`](#unsync).

#### Arguments

```
desk ship desk
```

The first `desk` is the local target, the second is the source on the specified
`ship`.

#### Example

```
> |sync %webterm ~bus %webterm
>=
kiln: finding ship and desk from %webterm on ~bus to %webterm
kiln: activated sync from %webterm on ~bus to %webterm
kiln: beginning sync from %webterm on ~bus to %webterm
kiln: sync succeeded from %webterm on ~bus to %webterm
```

---

### `|syncs`

List currently active desk syncs.

#### Example

```
> |syncs
>=
kiln: sync configured from %webterm on ~bus to %webterm
```

---

### `|tomb`

Tombstone a file at a particular revision.

Tombstoning means deleting a file's data in an old revision in [Clay][clay],
only leaving the file reference.

This can only tombstone a single file, it cannot recursively tombstone a
directory. If a directory is specified, it will fail.

The desk revision number specified cannot be the current revision, it must be an
old one. This will only tombstone the file at the specified revision, not any
revisions before it.

Note this will also execute any other unapplied tombstone policies as it sends
Clay a `%pick` garbage collection task.

#### Arguments

```
path, =dry ?
```

The [path][path] is mandatory, it's a path to a file including the full [path
prefix][path prefix]. If the optional `=dry` argument is `.y`, it will perform a
dry run and not actually tombstone the file.

#### Examples

```
> -read %x our %base ud+3 /foo/txt
bar

> |tomb /=base/3/foo/txt
>=
tomb: [~tus %base /foo/txt 0vr.46d5h.ocj13.age48.mnpnd.567me.1f6uc.9haq8.5ihru.b302i.agt4c [fil=~ dir={}] /foo/txt]

> -read %x our %base ud+3 /foo/txt
(fail)
```

---

### `|unmount`

Unmount a previously [mounted](#mount) desk or directory.

Note that any uncommitted changes on the host side will be discarded.

#### Arguments

```
term
```

If the thing you're unmount is a [desk][desk], you'll just specify the desk
name. If it's a sub-directory of a desk, you must specify the mount-point, which
is whatever the directory is called in the host filesystem. For example, if you
mounted `%/gen` and it's at `<pier>/gen`, you'd specify `%gen` here.

#### Example

Unmount the `%base` desk:

```
> |unmount %base
>=
```

---

### `|unsync`

Stop syncing a desk with another.

#### Arguments

```
desk ship desk
```

The first `desk` is the local one receiving updates, the second `desk` is the
source for updates on the specified `ship`.

#### Example

```
> |unsync %webterm ~bus %webterm
>=
kiln: ended autosync from %webterm on ~bus to %webterm
```

---
## Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous utilities.

### `+hello`

Hello, world.

#### Arguments

```
term
```

#### Example

```
> +hello %foo
'hello, foo'
```

---

### `|hi`

Ping another ship with an optional message.

The hi and message will be displayed in that ship's dojo. This is useful for
testing connectivity.

#### Arguments

```
ship tape
```

The target `ship` is mandatory, the `tape` is an optional message.

#### Example

Without a message:

```
:: in ~zod's dojo:

> |hi ~bus
>=
hi ~bus successful

:: in ~bus's dojo:

< ~zod:
```

With a message:

```
:: in ~zod's dojo:

> |hi ~bus "hello"
>=
hi ~bus successful

:: in ~bus's dojo:

< ~zod: hello
```

---

### `+sponsor`

Print out the sponsor of this ship.

#### Examples

```
> +sponsor
~zod
```

---

### `+keys`

Print the `life` (key revision number) and `rift` (continuity number aka factory
reset number) for a ship.

#### Arguments

```
ship
```

#### Example

```
> +keys our
[life=[~ 1] rift=[~ 1]]

> +keys ~sampel-palnet
[life=[~ 1] rift=[~ 1]]
```

---

## Moons

These tools are for spawning and managing [moons][moon].

### `|moon`

Spawn a new moon.

#### Arguments

```
ship, =public-key pass
```

All arguments are optional. If the `ship` is not specified, it'll spawn a random
moon. If it's specified, it will spawn the given moon.

If `=public-key` is specified, it'll configure the moon with the given public
key rather than generating a new key pair. This is useful if your planet has
breached and forgotten about its moon.

If spawning a new moon, it will spit out the moon's private key, a long code
which looks like `0wn6bMe.l1......`. You can copy this and save it in a `.key` file, then give the key file as an argument to the runtime when booting the moon like:

```
urbit -w sampel-sampel-sampel -k my-moon.key
```

You can also give the runtime the key directly by using `-G` rather than `-k`.

#### Example

Spawn a random moon:

```
> |moon
>=
moon: ~maglys-filted-dozzod-dozbus
0wn6bMe.l1~4K.KDRwj.rJMO1.4Km4h.xqXPo.0MNPP.HjyJF.5y6yc.vMYuc.6ZLW~.JOfLa.nVCm2.VH7sl.xTDAE.inSBu.EL7M5.gx0y0.1NPYe.57000.0mTU1
```

Spawn a specific moon:

```
> |moon ~sampel-dozzod-dozbus
>=
moon: ~sampel-dozzod-dozbus
0w1p.ihqFP.tIP1f.BhPf3.DLZDr.MomhE.~NyqB.wpkPN.KiYhA.rkTbo.OApoe.V0AIx.NI2-Q.Y-vBU.aKOMW.NwagX.iML~Q.mjFzE.g6w0s.oTw00.0mOU1
```

Register an existing moon with the given public key:

```
|moon ~sampel-dozzod-dozbus, =public-key 0w8H.oarut.wDiYO.P~5KZ.PFFtm.jpOVa.k2n6r.hsbbN.fBi9w.L4ftw.wlajH.-exB5.BdaRC.EVfD1.zfR~f.e73-W.KtaY-.Qdchy
>=
```

---

### `|moon-breach`

Breach (factory reset) a [moon][moon].

This is run on the moon's parent planet. Note that breaching a moon will require
to you boot it from scratch with its original keys. Breaching a moon, unlike a
planet, will not change its keys. If you no longer have its original keys you'll
also need to run [`|moon-cycle-keys`](#moon-cycle-keys) to generate new ones.

#### Arguments

```
ship, =rift @ud
```

The `ship` is mandatory, it's the moon to breach. The `=rift` is optional, it's
the continuity number (factory reset number). You'd specify a `=rift` if you'd
factory reset the parent planet and need to skip ahead to a particular rift to
match the existing moon. Note you can't turn the rift backwards, only forwards.

#### Example

```
> +keys ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr
[life=[~ 1] rift=[~ 0]]

> |moon-breach ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr
>=

> +keys ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr
[life=[~ 1] rift=[~ 1]]

> |moon-breach ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr, =rift 5
>=

> +keys ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr
[life=[~ 1] rift=[~ 5]]
```

---

### `|moon-cycle-keys`

Change the keys of a [moon][moon].

This is run on the moon's parent. Once you've cycled the moon's keys on its
parent, you'll need to run [`|rekey`](#rekey) on the moon itself with the new
keys that are printed.

#### Arguments

```
ship, =life life, =public-key pass
```

The `ship` is mandatory, it's the moon to rekey. The `=life` and `=public-key`
are optional.

You'd only specify a `=life` if you needed to jump ahead to a particular key
revision. You'd only specify a `=public-key` if you need the moon to have a
particular public key. The only time you'd need either of these optional
arguments is if you've breach the moon's planet and need to get it back in sync
with the existing moon. Note you can only go forward with the `=life`, not
backwards.

#### Example

Change the keys for a moon:

```
> |moon-cycle-keys ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr
moon: ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr
0w1.Nqi99.2~xO3.XtTv8.PRR1N.j-Fxu.PqlYT.rgqdD.RVNCD.TQA9R.Chk-n.mKLsQ.oSgu1.6fc7j.8p7h1.BrKuE.5Wdc2.8j2h4
```

The long code beginning with `0w1.Nq...` are its new private keys. You'd give
that code to the [`|rekey`](#rekey) command on the moon itself.

Rekey to a specific `life` (key revision):

```
> |moon-cycle-keys ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr, =life 5
>=
moon: ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr
0w2.FP28W.93aWD.FMyO-.j0z4e.x2cLA.bDnbB.OQNJY.A5DdJ.PbnzU.bAPVr.nb6uF.i1HvF.jQYwS.TDLJf.oVMr4.c-WyM.JLcm3
```

Rekey to a specific `life` and with a specific public key:

```
> |moon-cycle-keys ~lisret-namdev-ralnup-ribsyr, =life 10, =public-key 0w2.oLIwB.dH7BH.GCx3Y.ZQRZe.opK44.GK-HB.Mttqw.lz4FF.neRU3.SudC4.3l0we.UyMWg.dNmLx.rmT-i.SwZtg.nXy7o.wwzGC
>=
```

---

## Spider

```

The `term` is mandatory, it's the name of a thread in `/ted` in the current
desk. The `vase` is optional, it's the start arguments for the thread if needed.

Note this tool looks for the thread in the *current desk*, so you'll have to
change desk with `=dir` if you want to run one elsewhere.

#### Example

```
> :spider|start %hi !>([~ our "foo"])
>=
< ~zod: foo
```

---

### `:spider|stop`

Loud:

```
> |knob %foo %loud
>=

> |pass [%d %crud %foo 'blah blah' ~]
>=
crud: %foo event failed
blah blah

Soft:

```
> |knob %foo %soft
>=

> |pass [%d %crud %foo 'blah blah' ~]
>=
crud: %foo event failed
```

Hush:

```

### `|mass`

Print a memory report.

#### Examples

```
~zod:dojo> |mass
.....(truncated for brevity).....
total road stuff: B/376
space profile: KB/12.936
total marked: MB/176.019.156
free lists: MB/35.927.760
sweep: MB/176.019.156
```

---

### `|meld`

Deduplicate memory.

Note this can take a large amount of memory to complete if the ship's existing
memory footprint is large. If the host OS has limited memory, it may be more
efficient to shut down the ship and [run it directly from the
runtime](/manual/running/vere#meld).

#### Example

```
> |meld
>=
~zod:dojo> hash-cons arena:
  root: B/160
  atoms (41308):
    refs: KB/927.360
    data: MB/48.373.356
    dict: MB/1.416.880
  total: MB/50.717.596
  cells (3500719):
    refs: MB/70.491.560
    dict: MB/281.966.240
  total: MB/352.457.800
total: MB/403.175.556

pier: meld complete
```

---

### `|pack`

Defragment memory.

This is lighter than [`|meld`](#meld) on memory usage but does not compact the
ship's state as much.

#### Example

```
> |pack
>=
~zod:dojo> serf: pack: gained: MB/1.729.528
pier: pack complete
```

---


### `|rekey`

Rotate private keys.

**Note this should not be used unless you've changed your network keys on
[Bridge][bridge] first. Using this incorrectly will render your ship unable to
communicate.**

Note also this is not for when you perform a factory reset, this is specifically
for if you change your keys *without* a factory reset.

If your ship is a [moon][moon], you'd do the key change on its parent planet
rather than through Bridge, and then use `|rekey` on the moon itself.

#### Arguments

```
@t
```

This is the long code inside the `sampel-palnet-1.key` file you downloaded from
Bridge (or the code that your planet printed out in the dojo if a moon). It'll
look like `0w9oBR.dfY5Z.LSxut.YHe3u....`. You must wrap it in single-quotes when
giving it to this generator, like `'0w9oBR.dfY5Z.LSxut.YHe3u...'`.

#### Example

```
|rekey '0w3.N7qWC.LmuS5.rY6Rb.DQxmF.ta3vf.sOQvP.xOnhv.3P7sL.SjQqb.IbAKo.EU2vM.04S6U.VStzI.RNXij.YntkC.RRG29.AqaLf'
```

### `|verb`

Toggle kernel event tracing verbose mode.

When enabled, this will print a [move][move] trace for every event in
[Arvo][arvo].

#### Example

Toggle on:

```
> |verb
>=
%helm-verb
[ "|||||"
  %give
  %gall
  [%unto %fact]
  i=/gall/use/hood/0w2.cKFc6/out/~tus/dojo/1/drum/phat/~tus/dojo
  t=~[/dill //term/1]
]
[ "|||||"
  %give
  %gall
  [%unto %fact]
  i=/gall/use/hood/0w2.cKFc6/out/~tus/dojo/1/drum/phat/~tus/dojo
  t=~[/dill //term/1]
]
........
```

Run `|verb` again to turn it off.

---

### `|trim`

Trim kernel state.

This command is used to reduce memory pressure. Currently, the only two
[vanes][vane] that do anything with a `%trim` task are [Eyre][eyre] and
[Clay][clay]. Eyre closes inactive channels and Clay clears its build cache.
Typically these things use little memory so the impact of `|trim` is minimal and
it is not useful. For significant memory reduction, see [`|meld`](#meld) and
[`|pack`](#pack).

#### Arguments

```
@ud
```

You may *optionally* give a trim priority number as an argument. The lower the
number, the higher the priority. Currently, none of the vanes do anything with
this so there's no point in specifying it.

#### Example

```
> |trim
>=
```
